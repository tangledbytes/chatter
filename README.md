# CHATTER - A simple yet powerful chat application
### Note: The app is still in its initial development stage and is not yet ready for production. The aim is to create a fully scalable chat application. Don't clone the application as it might not work on your system, it is not yet ready for production and uses many logging as well as developer tools which might lead it to malfunction.

Technologies used: 
1) HTML (obviously)
2) CSS
3) ReactJS
4) Redux
5) React Router (I used client side rendering as opposed to server side rendering as I aim to make it a progressive web app with certain heavy javascript functionality to be available in the offline mode).
6) Node.js 
7) Express.js (In future it might be replaced with hapi.js as I prefer it for apis, suggestions are most welcome)
8) JWT for token based authentication as opposed to session based authentication.
9) Passport.js(For validation of tokens though it wasn't required at thi stage but in future it is aimed to be used for oauth)
10) Mongodb(ORM - Mongoose.js)
11) Socket.io powers the chat interface
